# Making & indexing data in R 

### Vectors 

Making Vectors

```{r}
goodbois <- c("teddy", "tango", "heidi", "coco", "baidi", "fudo")

#check class of goodbois
typeof(goodbois)
class(goodbois)

```

```{r}
my_breakfast <- c("coffee", 2, TRUE, "raisinbran")
typeof(my_breakfast)
class(my_breakfast)

```

```{r}
weights <- c(50L, 60L, 25L, 35L, 55L)
typeof(weights)
class(weights)
```

```{r}
is.numeric(weights)
```

```{r}
zipcodes <- c(93105, 93514, 93101, 93401)

class(zipcodes)


# Use as. family of functions to recast data classes
# Use is. family of functions to ASK what class something is
zipcodes_chr <- as.character(zipcodes)


```

```{r}
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora= "alpo", waffle="fancy feast", banjo = "blue diamond", tallie = "farmer's dog")
class(dog_food)
test <- c(cat = 4, dog = 10, elephant = 11)
class(test)


dog_food[1]
#R USES A 1-INDEX. PYTHON & JAVASCRIPT USES A 0-INDEX#
```

access ranges of values in a vector

Use: to refer to a range (low : high)

```{r}
trees <- c("ponderosa", "lodgepole", "jeffrey", "sugar", "white", "bristle cone")
trees[3]
trees[3:5]
```

## Warm-up for Loops 

```{r}
i <- 4 #indexing helper
trees[4]

```

```{r}
i <- seq(1:4) #same thing as seq(from=1, to=3)
trees[i] #gives every item in trees
```

```{r}
trees[3] <- "OAK"
```
